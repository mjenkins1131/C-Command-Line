# C-Command-Line
Original version of my system software command line project. The improved version was lost due to hardware failures. I will improve this version in the future. 

This is a simple command line environment written in c++. The code only has commands for creating/deleting files, creating/deleting directories, showing the statistics of a file, and creating a file system.
